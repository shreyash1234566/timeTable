**DURING EXAM (120 MINUTES):**

### **⏱️ YOUR EXECUTION STRATEGY**

**Minutes 1-15: SCAN MODE**
- Walk through entire paper
- Mark each question with pen:
  - ✓ = Attack (green in your mind)
  - X = Retreat (red in your mind)
  - ~ = Borderline (maybe if time)
- **DO NOT SOLVE YET**
- Just identify and mark

**Minutes 16-95: ATTACK MODE (80 min)**

**Phase 1 (20 min):** Super Easy Attack Topics
- English: Known idioms, obvious errors
- Reasoning: Dot situations, simple Venns
- GK: Defense facts you studied
- Maths: Direct percentage, average

**Phase 2 (30 min):** Moderate Attack Topics
- English: RC (1 story passage), sentence improvement
- Reasoning: Mirror images, coding, blood relations
- Maths: P&L, Ratio, SI, Trains (single)
- GK: Sports, Awards, Current affairs

**Phase 3 (30 min):** Remaining ✓ Marked Questions
- Attempt all remaining Attack topics
- **IGNORE all X marked (Retreat) questions**
- **If 30-second rule breaks → Skip and move on**

**Minutes 96-115: REVIEW MODE (20 min)**
- Go through all marked answers
- Check for silly mistakes
- Attempt 3-5 "~" marked questions if 100% confident
- **DO NOT touch X marked questions**
- **DO NOT change answers unless 100% sure of mistake**

**Minutes 116-120: CALM MODE (Final 4 min)**
- Deep breath
- Final check: Name, roll number filled?
- Submit with confidence
- **Don't think about answers - it's done**
